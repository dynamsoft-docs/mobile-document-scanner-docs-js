# Frameworks

Dynamsoft provides samples that show how to integrate Dynamsoft Document Scanner and Mobile Web Capture in various frameworks. We recommend using our samples as references when building web applications with DDS and MWC with frameworks.

> [!NOTE]
> Please [contact us](https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact/) for any inquiries about currently unsupported frameworks.

## Web Framework Samples

We host samples with Hello World implementations of DDS and MWC on GitHub, in the same repository as the source code for the SDKs. Follow the README contained in the directory of each sample for instructions to build and serve the sample:
