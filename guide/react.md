# 📦 Document Scanner - React

This sample demonstrates how to use the `Document Scanner` API from the [Dynamsoft Document Scanner SDK](https://www.dynamsoft.com/mobile-document-scanner/docs/web/introduction/index.html) in a **React** app to capture and scan documents using the camera.

## ✨ Features

- Easy integration with pre-built UI
- Renders Document Scanner inside a React component
- Captures and processes documents from video stream
- Mobile-optimized scanning interface
- Automatic document detection and cropping

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20.19.0 or later**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure License Key

Search for the string `"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"` in the sample and replace it with your actual license key.

#### Get a Trial License

You can try **MDS** by requesting a trial license through our [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=mwc&utm_source=github_react_readme). The trial can be renewed twice for up to two months of free access.

> [!NOTE] > **MDS** and **MWC** share the same license keys. The license portal currently shows **Mobile Web Capture** but requesting this license will provide access to both **MDS** and **MWC** functionality. If you already have a **MWC** license, you can use it for **MDS**, and vice versa.

#### Get a Full License

To purchase a full license, [contact us](https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact?product=mwc&utm_source=github_react_readme).

### 3. Start the App

```bash
npm start
```

Then open https://localhost:3000/ to view the sample app.
