# Mobile Document Scanner - Vue

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article builds on the prerequisite [MDS developer guide]({{ site.guide }}index.html) for plain JavaScript; please read it before proceeding.

Mobile Document Scanner integrates easily with Vue applications. Just as in plain JavaScript, you can add document scanning in your **Vue application** in just a few lines of code, and achieve most customizations through the same accessible configuration object.

## Features

- Easy integration with pre-built UI
- Render MDS inside a Vue component
- Capture and process documents from video stream
- Automatic document detection and cropping
- Mobile-optimized scanning interface
- TypeScript support with type definitions

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20.19.0 or later**
- [Base requirements]({{ site.introduction }}index.html#system-requirements)

## License

### Get a Trial License

Try **MDS** by requesting a trial license through our [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=mwc&utm_source=github_vue_readme). You can renew the license twice for up to a total of two months of free access.

### Get a Full License

[Contact us](https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact?product=mwc&utm_source=github_vue_readme) to purchase a full license.

## Quick Start

We publish **MDS** library files on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamsoft-document-scanner) to make them simple to reference from a CDN. We reference the library files in our _ready-made_ Hello World sample for Vue included in our GitHub source repository:

1. Download **MDS** from [GitHub](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/document-scanner-javascript) as a compressed folder.

2. Extract the contents of the archive, and open the extracted directory in a code editor.

3. Set your [license key](#get-a-trial-license) in the **Vue framework sample**:
    1. Open the sample at [`/samples/frameworks/vue/src/App.vue`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/document-scanner-javascript/blob/main/document-scanner-javascript-dev/samples/frameworks/vue/src/App.vue).
    2. Search for `"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"`, then replace it with your actual license key.

### Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Start the App

```shell
npm run serve
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/ to view the sample app.

## Self-Host Resources

You can self host the resources for the Hello World by following a few simple steps. Refer to the [plain JavaScript self-hosting guide]({{ site.guide }}index.html#quick-start) for details.

### Set File Paths

First we set MDS to look resource paths where we will place the resources later:

```typescript
const documentScanner = new Dynamsoft.DocumentScanner({
  license: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE",
  scannerViewConfig: {
    cameraEnhancerUIPath: "dist/libs/dynamsoft-document-scanner/dist/document-scanner.ui.html",
  },
  engineResourcePaths: {
    rootDirectory: "dist/libs/"
  },
});
```

### Move Resources

Now, add a script (`get-libs`) to automatically move the resources to their destination when building the project (`build`) in `samples/framework/vue/package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "tsc && vite build && npm run get-libs",
  "get-libs": "npm install --no-save dynamsoft-capture-vision-data dynamsoft-capture-vision-bundle && npx mkdirp /dist/libs && npx cpx 'node_modules/dynamsoft-*/**/*' dist/libs/ --dereference",
  "preview": "vite preview"
},
```

## Customization

Please check the official [documentation]({{ site.guide }}index.html).
